### Ruby Style Guide
We use RuboCop to enforce code style. Key points:

- **Line length**: 120 characters maximum
- **Follow Ruby community conventions**

### Testing Standards
- **Write tests** for all new functionality

### Documentation Standards
- **Update README.md** for user-facing changes
- **Add inline comments** for complex logic
- **Update CHANGELOG.md** for notable changes
- **Use clear, concise language**

## Commit Guidelines

### Commit Messages
Follow these guidelines for commit messages:
- **Use present tense** ("Add feature" not "Added feature")
- **Use imperative mood** ("Move cursor to..." not "Moves cursor to...")
- **Limit first line to 72 characters**
- **Reference issues and pull requests** when applicable

### Examples
```
Add support for custom service detection patterns

- Update configuration documentation
- Add comprehensive tests

Closes #123
```

## Review Process
