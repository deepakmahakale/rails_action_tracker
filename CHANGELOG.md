## [Unreleased]

## [0.2.0] - 2025-09-03

### Added
- **Separate Print and Log Format Support**: Configure different output formats for console display (`print_format`) and file logging (`log_format`)
- **JSON Accumulation**: JSON format now accumulates all actions in a single valid JSON file with intelligent data merging
- **CSV Accumulation**: CSV format accumulates all actions in a single file with dynamic headers that expand as new tables/services are discovered
- **Ruby 3.0 Support**: Full compatibility testing with Ruby 3.0
- **Rails 7.0 and 7.1 Support**: Extended Rails version compatibility through Rails 7.1
- **Enhanced File Operations**: Automatic directory creation, malformed file recovery, atomic file operations
- **Thread-safe File Locking**: Prevents corruption during concurrent writes
- **Smart Access Pattern Merging**: Access patterns merge intelligently (R + W = RW) when same action visited again
- **11 Configuration Examples**: Comprehensive configuration scenarios in initializer template

### Changed
- **Expanded CI Matrix**: Now tests Ruby 2.7 and 3.0 with Rails 6.0, 6.1, 7.0, 7.1 (8 combinations)
- **Improved Code Quality**: Refactored complex methods to meet RuboCop standards
